Guide for Setting Up Candy Machine User Interface
Introduction
This guide offers a detailed walkthrough on configuring the user interface (UI) for your Candy Machine. The UI facilitates the minting of NFTs using the SPL token you've generated, with users employing their Phantom wallets for the minting process.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

1. A properly configured Candy Machine with specific details in its config.json file, including price, quantity, symbol, seller fee basis points, SPL token account, SPL token, go-live date, and creator details.
2. A designated Phantom wallet for minting.
3. A newly created SPL token.

Steps
1. SPL Token Setup
If not done already, create the SPL token following Lesson Three guidelines, and take note of the SPL token's address.

2. Update Candy Machine Config
Edit the config.json file of your Candy Machine, and update the following fields:

- `splTokenAccount`: Replace it with the address of the created SPL token account.
- `splToken`: Replace it with the SPL token address.

3. UI Configuration
Refer to the tutorial "Quick Node: Set Up a Minting Site" for instructions on creating a UI for your Candy Machine. This UI empowers users to connect their Phantom wallets and mint NFTs using the SPL token as payment.

4. Adjust Minting Logic
In your SPL project's minting logic (as per Lesson Three), make the necessary modifications to mint NFTs to the Phantom wallet address or adapt the transfer function to deliver minted NFTs to your Phantom wallet.

5. Testing
Thoroughly test the entire setup by transferring or minting your SPL token to a Phantom account. Use the UI to mint NFTs, ensuring a seamless process for users paying in the designated SPL token.
